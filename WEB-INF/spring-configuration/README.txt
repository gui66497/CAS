INTRODUCTION
The spring-configuration directory is a "convention-over-configuration" option
for CAS deployers.  It allows you to drop a Spring XML configuration file into
this directory and have CAS automatically find it (after the typical application
restart).  It eliminates the need for you to register that file in the web.xml

ADVANTAGES
By automatically breaking the configuration into smaller "bite-sized" pieces
you can easily override small components of CAS without worrying about merging
huge pieces of configurations files together later.

The configuration-over-convention option also allows you to add new configuration
options without editing existing configuration files.

This should make tracking changes and maintaining local modifications easier.

GOTCHAS AND THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR
If you name a local bean and an existing bean the same thing, there will be a major
collision.  Deployment will fail.  The sky will fall! (okay that last part isn't
true).    Spring will be merging all of these files together so every bean must
have unique names.  The only way around this is if you override the file completely.
i.e. override the ticketRegistry.xml allows you to re-use the "ticketRegistry"
id.
 
In addition, if there is a typographical/XML parsing error in a file, the
application will not deploy.
